Analytic computation of the number of lensed quasars that JPAS will be able to observe

Future: prediction of the distribution of separation, prediction from the mock catalogues, prediction of the constrain on the cosmo

draw_gravlens.py: routine to initialize gravlens files to run a Monte Carlo to compute the biased lensing cross-section.

lens.py: python routine to compute the number of lensed qsos.
